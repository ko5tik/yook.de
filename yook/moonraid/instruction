<P>Fly with your ship through gates and zap all the aliens with your laser. Avoid collision with gates and aliens and keep an eye on the fuel amount (&nbsp;you will get extra fuel if you fly between the gates&nbsp;) and laser temperature. You can avoid collisions by flying higher, but in this case you will not get any fuel and cannot hit the aliens. Head-up display will dim if you are too high.
    <P>You will need java 1.1 enabled in your browser to play this game (&nbsp;Netscape 4.06 and up is fine&nbsp;). You will also need fast machine to handle all the animation.
<P>Use following keys to steer the ship:
<UL>
<LI>Arrow keys - moves ship left, right, up and down. 
<LI>Space - shoot.
<LI>S - toggle sound.

<P>When your last life is out, you will see highscore submission panel. Enter your
name there , and press "Save Score" button to submit your achievement into hall of
fame (&nbsp;it will open new browser window, where you will see your placement&nbsp;). Press "Play again" button to start a new game. Since Netscape likes to take 
input focus away from applets, you will have to click with a mouse inside applet.
Press "Show score" button to see highscore list.
<P>Extra ships are available at 20000 and 50000 points. Then every 50000. <B>Good luck!</B>
<H3>Known problems</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Netscape is known to take away input focus from the applets. So if applet does
not react to keyboard you will have to click with the mouse inside the applet. If you
encounter other problems during the game please send report to <A href="mailto:kpriblouda@yahoo.com?subject=moonraid game feedback">kpriblouda@yahoo.com</A>
<LI>Java 1.1.6 and up is needed to play this.
<LI>Apple versions of netscape do not like java 1.1 very much.
</UL>
