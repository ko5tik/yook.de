Well, not much to say. It's "pack falling tiles"-game. For a first time I seen it 
around 1983-1984 on a dumb ASCII terminals (VT-52) connected to PDP-8.
Dumb ASCII terminals and PDP's became extinct, but not "stakan".
This game survived in arcade machines, handheld devices,
WindBlows PC's and other strange appliances. Now it's one click away 
from your browser window.
