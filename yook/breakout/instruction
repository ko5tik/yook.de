<H3>Known problems</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Netscape is known to take away input focus from the applets. So if applet does
not react to keyboard you will have to click with the mouse inside the applet. If you
encounter other problems during the game please send report to <A href="mailto:kpriblouda@yahoo.com?subject=moonraid game feedback">kpriblouda@yahoo.com</A>
<LI>Java 1.1.6 and up is needed to play this.
<LI>Apple versions of netscape do not like java 1.1 very much.
