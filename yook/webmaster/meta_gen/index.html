<p>Search engine guts are close guarded secret. Nobody can say for sure
that he knows how they select pages based on user query (except for
Search engine developers, but they will not say us anything).
<p>From logical point of view, meta tags are important for search engine 
position. Your documents are indexed based on their contens. There is a ground to believe, that search engines will also look inside your
document, to determine whether your meta tags correspond to your content.
<p>This tool will fetch your page, like search engine does, parse it and build
a list of keywords based on amount of occurences inside your page.
<p>This way you can build effective meta tags based on content of your page.
