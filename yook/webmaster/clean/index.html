<p>Whether you use visual HTML editors, or notepad. You HTML code can contain
unnecessary stuff: unneeded meta tags, excess spaces, default values in HTML elements, color specifications that are too long etc.
<p>This stuff makes your page bigger, without serving
any real puprose (whitespaces may add readability to your HTML code, 
but web browser are not humans...) Bigger pages take longer to load, 
thus making your surfers  impatient, increasing IP traffic of your webserwer,
and wasting precious bandwidth of its internet connection.
<p>Shrinking your page size by 10% means smaller bills and 
faster website.
