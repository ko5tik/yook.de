This is historical site featuring my java applet games -  not sure they work at all, but if the work  - enjoy them if they work. 
I had to upgrade my server, and backend technologies (used since 1999 unchanged, mostly HTML::mason) became unmaintainable. I will not 
put much effort in restoring backend functionality,  and some games were ported  to android instead. You may look for them [here](http://www.pribluda.de/android/)
